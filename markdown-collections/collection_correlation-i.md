  As an accompaniment to the Interaction series, this series expresses the
  mutual relation of two or more things. Rather than representing the
  relationship between metaphysical elements, this series represents the
  relationship between the elements of a visual work of art. While every piece
  of visual art work is an exploration of this relationship, this series makes
  the exploration its point of existence. Its style, abstract expressionism, is
  used as a medium to communicate this relationship, rather than as an outcome
  of the relationship.
