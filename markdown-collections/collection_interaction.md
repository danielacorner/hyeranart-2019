  The proceedings of our daily events, the stories in our lives, are coordinated
  by various forces. This series of non-objective expressionist works aims to
  present the characteristics of this metaphysical energy: flow, movement, and
  freedom. Through bold and thin gesture lines, and the contrast of value,
  colour, and space, it is an expression of life through imagery.


  The process of creating such images starts with a variety of sketches, each
  sketch only containing the boldest lines in the painting. Sketches are then
  selected to create a polyptych piece, or a standalone piece. Broad brush
  strokes are used to create both the gentle and bold line work, several layers
  of gesso helps to soften lines. In parts, the layers of plain gesso are coated
  with gesso tinted with acrylic paint, to add subtle colour. In between layers
  of brushwork, relief prints are made onto the canvas with Styrofoam
  engravings. In softening the impressions of the prints, a cushioned material
  such as Styrofoam instead of wood, and applications of water on the matrix are
  effective. The process for this series has been progressive in development,
  and as a result many pieces contain different aspects of the process.
