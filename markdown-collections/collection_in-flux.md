  A personal philosophy about the intricate balance and spirituality of the
  universe pervades this piece. The work represents the two essential opposing
  forces of life: the dynamic and the static, and the powerful and the weak.
  Humans experience a constant change of state between the forces of life, as do
  the other elements of life, such as nature. Everything exists in a network of
  these forces. This non-objective expressionist work aims to present this flow,
  movement, and freedom of energy. Through the bold and thin brush gesture lines
  and the contrast of value, colour, and space, it is a metaphysical reflection
  of everyday life and events.
