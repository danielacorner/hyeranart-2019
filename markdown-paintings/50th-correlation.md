moreInfo: "Painting: Acrylic on Canvas.\r\n\n\r\n\nThis series makes the exploration its point of Correlation.\r\n\n\r\n\nIts style, this abstract expressionism works aim to present the characteristics of this metaphysical energy: flow, movement, and freedom. Through bold and thin gesture lines, and the contrast of value, colour, and space, it is an expression of life through imagery.\r\n\n\r\n\nIt is done on the gallery wrapped canvas, with no need for framing, ready to hang and signed on the back."
